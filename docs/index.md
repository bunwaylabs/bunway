::: info Why bunWay?
- Bun-first: built around Bun.serve, native Request/Response objects, and the Bun test runner.
- Express-friendly: plug into familiar middleware and router patterns without losing Fetch semantics.
- Batteries included: JSON parsers, CORS, error handling, docs, and a roadmap toward sessions, cookies, and more.

## Try it in 30 seconds

```ts
import { bunway, cors, json } from "bunway";

const app = bunway();
app.use(cors({ origin: true }));
app.use(json());

app.get("/hello", (ctx) => ctx.res.json({ message: "Run everything. The Bun way." }));

app.listen(7070);
```

Drop the snippet into `bun run` and see Bun-native routing in action.
